  title = {Underwater {SLAM} for Structured Environments Using an Imaging Sonar},
  school = {Departament of Computer Engineering, Universitat de Girona},
  year = {2008},
  month = {September},
  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the navigation problem for autonomous
	underwater vehicles operating in artifcial structured environments
	like harbours, marinas, marine platforms and other similar scenarios.
	Obtaining an accurate position in such scenarios would notably increase
	the capabilities of underwater vehicles and open the door to real
	autonomous operation. Maintenance, inspection and surveillance of
	marine installations are only a few examples of possible applications.
	The principal contributions of this thesis consist of the development
	of different localization systems for those situations in which an
	a priori map of the environment is available but, in particular,
	in the development of a novel solution to the Simultaneous Localization
	and Mapping (SLAM) problem. This solution pursues the objective of
	providing an autonomous vehicle with the ability to build a map within
	an unknown environment while, at the same time, using this same map
	to keep track of its current position. A mechanical scanning imaging
	sonar has been chosen as the principal sensor for this work because
	of its relative low cost and its capacity to produce a rich representation
	of the environment. On the other hand, the particularities of its
	operation and, especially, its low scanning rate, have presented
	many challenges during the development of this proposed localization
	strategies. The solutions adopted to address these problems constitute
	another contribution in this thesis. The development of underwater
	vehicles and their use as experimental platforms is another important
	aspect of the research work presented here. Experiments carried out
	in both laboratory and real application environments have provided
	the different datasets necessary for the testing and evaluation of
	the different localization approaches. },
