	sustained self-pulsing (SSP) in a unidirectional ring-fiber laser
	using only the interaction between the saturated population inversion
	and the optical signal circulating in the laser cavity. Gain saturation
	alone is used to explain SML behavior close to laser threshold and
	the sharp transition to an SSP regime. The model also describes self-pulsing
	inhibition to the profit of SML for a sufficiently high pump power.
	Experimental results agree with most model predictions, but the overestimation
	of the self-pulsing threshold suggests that the phenomenon is furthered
	by an effect other than gain saturation.}

  abstract = {A geometric framework for the recognition of three- dimensional objects
	represented by point clouds is intro- duced in this paper. The proposed
	approach is based on comparing distributions of intrinsic measurements
	on the point cloud. In particular, intrinsic distances are exploited
	as signatures for representing the point clouds. The first signature
	we introduce is the histogram of pairwise dif- fusion distances between
	all points on the shape surface. These distances represent the probability
	of traveling from one point to another in a fixed number of random
	steps, the average intrinsic distances of all possible paths of a
	given number of steps between the two points. This signa- ture is
	augmented by the histogram of the actual pairwise geodesic distances,
	as well as the distribution of the ratio between these two distances.
	These signatures are not only geometric but also invariant to bends.
	We further augment these signatures by the distribution of a curvature
	func- tion and the distribution of a curvature weighted distance.
	These histograms are compared using the $\chi$2 or other com- mon
	distance metrics for distributions. The presentation of the framework
	is accompanied by theoretical justification and state-of-the-art
	experimental results with the standard Princeton 3D shape benchmark
	and ISDB datasets, as well as a detailed analysis of the particular
	relevance of each one of the different histogram-based signatures.
	Finally, we briefly discuss a more local approach where the histograms
	are computed for a number of overlapping patches from the object
	rather than the whole shape, thereby opening the door to partial
	shape comparisons.},
